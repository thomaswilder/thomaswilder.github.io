## Bio

I am a final year PhD student at the University of East Anglia working on mesoscale eddy-wind interactions. I am particularly interested in how eddy dynamics change in response to an interaction between winds and ocean currents.

When I am away from the office you can find me cycling over the hills of Norfolk, or running through a muddy field.
